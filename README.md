# DFInhibition-Legacy
A repository archiving the original [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) (1.20.1) plugin used for Season 1 and Season 2, in order to prevent players from progressing in the game before the allowed time.
The code provided is for Season 2, as the code base was adapted from Season 1 (and I've lost the Season 1 source code since)

> [!WARNING]
> The code for this Plugin is hacked together, in order to achieve the effect I was going for as fast as possible.  
> PSA: DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN. It'd probably make more sense to find another plugin, or just to write your own.  
> This plugin is only here for archival purposes.

## Dependencies
- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) (1.21.3+)
    - Unsure if PaperMC would work anymore
